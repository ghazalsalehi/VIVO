<p>	
The QUT Software Finder is a searchable registry of code and software which has been created as a result of QUT research activities. 
</p>
<p>
The registry is designed to aid the discovery and visibility of QUT research outputs and encourage sharing and re-use of code and software throughout the research community.
</p>
<p>
Records of software and code are connected to information on researchers, research groups, publications and related projects. 
Links to the software or code location are also provided alongside licencing and use information.     
</p>

<p>Researchers are encouraged to read <a target="_blank" href="/responsibilities">QUT&rsquo;s Statement of Responsibilities</a> before publishing their research data and/or metadata.</p>

<p>Researchers are also encouraged to complete a data management plan at the commencement of a research project. QUT's <a href="https://dmp.qut.edu.au/" target="_blank">Data Management Planning tool</a> can assist in creating plans and creating Software Finder records.<p>

<p>
<h4>Data Sharing at QUT</h4>
</p>


<p>
Software Finder is linked with the QUT Research Data Finder.
Information stored in QUT Research Data Finder is exposed to a wider research audience through selected external harvesters, including the <a href="http://www.ands.org.au/" target="_blank">Australian National Data Service</a> (through their discovery service, <a href="http://researchdata.ands.org.au/" target="_blank">Research Data Australia</a>), and the <a href="http://www.nla.gov.au/" target="_blank">National Library of Australia (NLA)</a> (through <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/people?q=" target="_blank">Trove</a>, the NLA&rsquo;s digital information portal), as well as being highly indexed by Google and other search engines.

<p>
The open sharing of research data benefits researchers through:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li type="square">Increased numbers of publication citations, leading to a higher h-index</li>
		<li type="square">Successful applications for promotion and tenure</li>
		<li type="square">More opportunities for collaboration with industry partners</li>
		<li type="square">Successful research grant applications</li>
		<li type="square">New discoveries and publications arising from the combination of datasets</li>
	</ul>
