<p>	
Spatial Data Finder is a registry or collection that allows the discovery of data sets that are spatial in nature. Spatial Data Finder provides descriptions about shareable, reusable datasets that may be of use to researchers for visualisation and analysis across a broad range of research fields. 
</p>
<p>
The collection is designed to aid the discovery and visibility of spatial data and encourage sharing and re-use throughout the research community. Records of spatial data are connected to information on researchers, research groups, publications and related projects. Links to the spatial data location are also provided alongside licencing and access information.
</p>
<p>
Spatial Data Finder is linked with QUT&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" href="https://researchdatafinder.qut.edu.au">Research Data Finder</a>. Information stored in both registries is exposed to a wider research audience through selected external harvesters, including the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ands.org.au/">Australian National Data Service</a> (through their discovery service, <a target="_blank" href="http://researchdata.ands.org.au/">Research Data Australia</a>), and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nla.gov.au/">National Library of Australia (NLA)</a> (through Trove, the NLA&rsquo;s digital information portal), as well as being highly indexed by Google and other search engines.     
</p>

<p>Researchers are encouraged to read <a target="_blank" href="/responsibilities">QUT&rsquo;s Statement of Responsibilities</a> before publishing their research data and/or metadata.</p>

<p>Researchers are also encouraged to complete a data management plan at the commencement of a research project. QUT's <a href="https://dmp.qut.edu.au/" target="_blank">Data Management Planning tool</a> can assist in creating plans and creating Spatial Data Finder records.<p>

<h4>Data Sharing at QUT</h4>
</p>


<p>
The open sharing of research data significantly supports research communities by: 
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li type="square">Saving time and money collecting data that might already exist</li>
		<li type="square">Advancing scientific discovery</li>
		<li type="square">Combining datasets to create new data</li>
		<li type="square">Re-purposing data to enable exploration of topics not envisioned by initial investigators</li>
		<li type="square">Eliminating duplication of data</li>
		<li type="square">Facilitating the verification of research</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
The open sharing of research data benefits researchers through:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li type="square">Increased numbers of publication citations, leading to a higher h-index</li>
		<li type="square">Successful applications for promotion and tenure</li>
		<li type="square">More opportunities for collaboration with industry partners</li>
		<li type="square">Successful research grant applications</li>
		<li type="square">New discoveries and publications arising from the combination of datasets</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
